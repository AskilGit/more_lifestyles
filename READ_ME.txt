# For translators: 
#
##################

The system explained below is designed to assist translators in identifying and tracking changes in localizations. 

Key Points:
- The English translation will always be up-to-date.
- You can disregard the notation system if you prefer.
- The patch notes on the steam page of this mod will indicate which notation corresponds to which update.
- In your own translations, you can change any number independently of the English translation and even remove them altogether; it won't affect the localization.



It allows to quickly identify the lines that have been changed in the latest update. 
Instead of manually searching for the modified lines, translators can easily track them down with a text editor and searching ':1'

# Guide
##################
In this mod, the numbering system in the localization has been repurposed. 
To make it easier for translators, all the lines modified in the last update are now marked with the notation ':1' for example:								 
								  ↓
								  ↓
-----  nht_prowess_lifestyle_name:1 "Prowess"


All unmodified lines will have the notation ':0' to indicate that they haven't been changed.
								  ↓
								  ↓
-----  nht_prowess_lifestyle_name:0 "Prowess"

This means you can quickly search on Notepad+++, Visual Studio Code or other text editor, with the search function, any lines that has been changed in the last update.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After each update, every modified line will have its notation increased by 1. For instance, all lines marked with ':1' will become ':2,' and so on.

								  ↓										    				  ↓
								  ↓										    				  ↓
-----  nht_prowess_lifestyle_name:1 "Prowess"   Becomes:    -----  nht_prowess_lifestyle_name:2 "Prowess"

And:

											↓										    									  ↓
											↓										    									  ↓
-----  game_concept_nht_secondary_lifestyle:2 "Secondary Lifestyle"    Becomes:   -----  game_concept_nht_secondary_lifestyle:3 "Secondary Lifestyle"


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This means that any translators who haven't been able to translate the previous updates,
can now see where the were changes made in the last four updates and when they occurred. After ':4' the notation will be reset to '0'
The patch notes on the steam page of this mod will indicate which notation corresponds to which update.

# Performance
##################
I recommend leaving a space before each line:
 nht_prowess_lifestyle_name:0 "Prowess"
 nht_prowess_lifestyle_desc:0 "Focus on leading armies, improving combat skills, the offense and defense of your character and realm."
 
Instead of this:
nht_prowess_lifestyle_name:0 "Prowess"
nht_prowess_lifestyle_desc:0 "Focus on leading armies, improving combat skills, the offense and defense of your character and realm."

The performance seems to be a little worse if the space is not respected for some reason, this applies to any mod.
